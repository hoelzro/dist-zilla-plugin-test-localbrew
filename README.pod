Dist::Zilla::Plugin::LocalBrew - Verify that your distribution tests well in a fresh perlbrew

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in your dist.ini
  [LocalBrew]
  brews = first-perlbrew
  brews = second-perlbrew

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin builds and tests your module with a set of given perlbrew
environments before a release and aborts the release if testing in any
of them fails.  Any dependencies are installed via cpanminus into
a temporary local lib, so your perlbrew environments aren't altered.
This comes in handy when you want to build against a set of "fresh" Perl
installations (ie. those with only core modules) to make sure all of your
prerequisites are included correctly.
