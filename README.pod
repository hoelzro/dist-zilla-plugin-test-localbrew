version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in your dist.ini
  [Test::LocalBrew]
  brews = first-perlbrew
  brews = second-perlbrew

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin adds a release test for your module that tests it against a set
of given perlbrew environments.  Any dependencies are installed via cpanminus
into a temporary local lib, so your perlbrew environments aren't altered.
This comes in handy when you want to build against a set of "fresh" Perl
installations (ie. those with only core modules) to make sure all of your
prerequisites are included correctly.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 brews
